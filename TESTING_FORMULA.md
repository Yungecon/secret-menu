---

### **2. Flavor Journey Path Testing**
**Path:** Landing Page → "Ingredient Spotlight" → Flavor Journey → Select Spirit → Select Flavor Family → Select Specific Flavor → Generate Cocktails

**Test Steps:**
1. Select the same spirit + flavor family + specific flavor combination 5 times
2. Record all generated cocktail names each time
3. Test different combinations to verify variety

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Generated cocktails should be **different** each time

- ✅ No immediate repetition of cocktails
- ✅ Different combinations should produce different results

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 4/5 generations produce unique cocktail sets
- No identical cocktail lists across runs
- Different spirit/flavor combinations produce different results

---

### **3. Slot Machine Path Testing**
**Path:** Landing Page → "Surprise Me" → Slot Machine → Tap to Stop Reels → Results

**Test Steps:**
1. Use slot machine 5 times with same reel combinations
2. Record primary and adjacent cocktail names each time
3. Test different reel combinations

2. Click on adjacent cocktails
3. Record new results after each click
4. Test "Try Another" functionality

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Clicking adjacent cocktails generates **new** recommendations
- ✅ "Try Another" resets and provides **fresh** results
- ✅ No immediate repetition after interactions

**Success Criteria:**
- Each click produces different cocktail sets
- "Try Another" provides completely fresh results

## 🔧 **Debugging Steps**

### **If Tests Fail:**

1. **Check Randomization:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify randomization is working
   console.log('Random factor:', Math.random());
   console.log('Timestamp seed:', Date.now());
   ```

2. **Check Recently Shown Tracking:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify tracking is working
   console.log('Recently shown:', recentlyShownCocktails);
   ```

3. **Check Engine Usage:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify all paths use same engine
   console.log('Using engine:', 'generateRecommendations');
   ```

4. **Check Data Loading:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify data is loaded properly
   console.log('Cocktail count:', cocktails.length);
   ```
