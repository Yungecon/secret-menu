### 6. Coverage Matrix Validation
**Priority: Medium | Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**

- [ ] **Create coverage validation script** to test all 216 combinations
- [ ] **Implement automated testing** for each quiz combination
- [ ] **Ensure minimum match scores** of 85% for each combination
- [ ] **Generate coverage report** showing gaps and recommendations
- [ ] **Fix any coverage gaps** found during validation

**Files to create:**
- `scripts/validate-coverage-matrix.js`
- `test-results/coverage-validation.json`

### 7. Update Analytics & Tracking
**Priority: Medium | Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

- [ ] **Enhance analytics tracking** for fuzzy matching usage
- [ ] **Add fallback matching metrics** to analytics
- [ ] **Track new three-option selections** in user behavior
- [ ] **Update recommendation analytics** with fuzzy match data

- [ ] **Add fuzzy matching tests** to recommendation engine
- [ ] **Create coverage validation tests** for all 216 combinations
- [ ] **Update integration tests** for enhanced user flow
- [ ] **Add performance tests** for fuzzy matching algorithms
- [ ] **Ensure test coverage** remains above 90%

**Files to modify:**
- `src/components/features/__tests__/QuizFlow.test.tsx`
