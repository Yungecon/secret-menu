# Enhanced Quiz Coverage Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the quiz system to provide complete coverage of all possible user preference combinations by adding third options to binary questions, implementing fuzzy matching in the recommendation engine, and enriching the cocktail database with missing tags.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Expand Quiz Options

**User Story:** As a user taking the quiz, I want more nuanced options that better represent my preferences, so that I can get more accurate cocktail recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters the flavor preference question THEN the system SHALL provide three options: Sweet & Luxurious, Bitter & Sophisticated, and Balanced & Harmonious
2. WHEN a user encounters the fruit family question THEN the system SHALL provide three options: Citrus & Bright, Stone Fruit & Rich, and Tropical & Exotic  
3. WHEN a user encounters the indulgence style question THEN the system SHALL provide three options: Light & Refreshing, Bold & Spirit-Forward, and Medium & Versatile
4. WHEN a user selects any of the new third options THEN the system SHALL track and process these selections in the recommendation engine
5. WHEN displaying quiz options THEN each option SHALL have appropriate luxury color themes that cycle through the available luxury theme system

### Requirement 2: Implement Fuzzy Matching

**User Story:** As a user with specific preferences, I want to receive relevant cocktail recommendations even when exact tag matches don't exist, so that I always get a meaningful result.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recommendation engine cannot find exact tag matches THEN it SHALL use ingredient analysis to infer cocktail characteristics
2. WHEN analyzing ingredients for sweetness THEN the system SHALL recognize simple syrup, honey, cream, chocolate, and fruit liqueurs as sweet indicators
3. WHEN analyzing ingredients for stone fruit characteristics THEN the system SHALL recognize peach, apricot, plum, and cherry ingredients as stone fruit indicators
4. WHEN analyzing ingredients for tropical characteristics THEN the system SHALL recognize pineapple, mango, coconut, and passion fruit as tropical indicators
5. WHEN no direct matches exist THEN the system SHALL fall back to similar flavor profiles with at least 85% match score
6. WHEN multiple fuzzy matches exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize cocktails with the most matching characteristics

### Requirement 3: Enrich Cocktail Database

**User Story:** As a user taking the quiz, I want every possible combination of my preferences to return relevant cocktail recommendations, so that the quiz always provides value regardless of my choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes the cocktail database THEN it SHALL ensure coverage for all possible quiz combinations (3×3×3×2×4 = 216 combinations)
2. WHEN a cocktail contains sweet ingredients THEN it SHALL be tagged with appropriate sweetness indicators
3. WHEN a cocktail contains stone fruit or tropical ingredients THEN it SHALL be tagged with appropriate fruit family indicators
4. WHEN a cocktail has balanced characteristics THEN it SHALL be tagged as "balanced" to support the new third options
5. WHEN the database is updated THEN each of the 216 possible combinations SHALL have at least one matching cocktail
6. WHEN tags are added THEN they SHALL maintain consistency with existing tag patterns and naming conventions

### Requirement 4: Maintain User Experience

**User Story:** As a user familiar with the current quiz, I want the enhanced version to feel natural and maintain the luxury aesthetic, so that the improvements enhance rather than disrupt my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the quiz displays three options instead of two THEN the layout SHALL remain visually balanced and elegant
2. WHEN new luxury color themes are applied THEN they SHALL cycle appropriately through gold, rose, brass, and emerald themes
3. WHEN the recommendation engine uses fuzzy matching THEN match scores SHALL remain in the 85-98% range to maintain the "magical" feeling
4. WHEN users receive recommendations THEN the quality and relevance SHALL be equal to or better than the current system
5. WHEN the system processes the expanded combinations THEN response times SHALL remain under 500ms for recommendation generation

### Requirement 5: Analytics and Validation

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track how the enhanced quiz performs compared to the current version, so that I can validate the improvements are working as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users select the new third options THEN the system SHALL track these selections in analytics
2. WHEN the recommendation engine uses fuzzy matching THEN it SHALL log which fallback methods were used
3. WHEN all 216 combinations are tested THEN each SHALL return at least one relevant cocktail recommendation
4. WHEN the enhanced system is deployed THEN recommendation relevance scores SHALL maintain or exceed current averages
5. WHEN users complete the enhanced quiz THEN completion rates SHALL remain at or above current levels
