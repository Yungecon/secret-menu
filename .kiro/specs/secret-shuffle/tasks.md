  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Create slot machine attribute data and mapping utilities
  - Define FLAVOR_ATTRIBUTES, MOOD_ATTRIBUTES, and STYLE_ATTRIBUTES arrays
  - Create utility function to convert slot machine results to quiz-compatible format
  - Implement attribute-to-tag mapping logic for recommendation engine integration
  - Write unit tests for attribute conversion and mapping functions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 3. Build SlotReel component with mechanical physics
  - Create individual reel component with spinning animation using CSS transforms
  - Implement mechanical deceleration with custom easing functions (1-2 second duration)
  - Add bounce/settle effect when reel stops for authentic slot machine feel
  - Create smooth 60fps spinning animation with proper GPU acceleration
  - Add premium visual styling with metallic appearance and subtle gradients
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.7, 2.8, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7_

- [ ] 4. Implement SlotMachine main component with three-reel interaction
  - Create main slot machine interface with three SlotReel components
  - Implement state management for reel states (spinning/decelerating/stopped)
  - Add tap-to-stop functionality with proper event handling
  - Create sequential reel stopping logic (tap 1 stops reel 1, tap 2 stops reel 2, etc.)
  - Display clear instructions: "Tap to stop reel 1 of 3", "Tap to stop reel 2 of 3", etc.
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 5. Add visual feedback and premium interactions
  - Implement immediate visual feedback for tap interactions (button press effects)
  - Add haptic feedback for mobile devices when tapping to stop reels
  - Create celebration animations when each reel stops with premium styling
  - Add smooth transitions between reel stopping states
  - Implement progress indication showing which reel is next to stop
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Create SlotMachineResults component and integration
  - Build results display component that shows selected attribute combination
  - Display gracious copy: "The reels have aligned! Your combination of [attributes] reveals..."
  - Convert slot machine results to quiz-compatible format for recommendation engine
  - Integrate with existing Results component for cocktail display
  - Add "Spin Again" and "Try the Quiz Instead" navigation options
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Integrate with existing recommendation engine and results display
  - Ensure slot machine results use same recommendation engine as quiz
  - Verify that converted attributes properly match cocktails from existing database
  - Test that adjacent cocktail recommendations work with slot machine results
  - Maintain same premium presentation format as quiz results
  - Ensure no additional database configuration is required
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 8. Add analytics tracking for slot machine usage
  - Implement "slot_machine_started" event tracking when user accesses shuffle feature
  - Track individual reel stops with selected attributes
  - Add "slot_machine_completed" event with final attribute combination and matched cocktail
  - Track "spin_again_clicked" and navigation between features
  - Ensure analytics failures don't impact user experience
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 9. Optimize animations and performance
  - Ensure all animations maintain 60fps performance on mobile devices
  - Implement GPU acceleration for smooth reel spinning
  - Add reduced motion support for accessibility preferences
  - Optimize bundle size impact by reusing existing components
  - Test performance on slower devices and optimize as needed
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.7_

- [ ] 10. Write comprehensive tests for slot machine functionality
  - Create unit tests for reel physics and mechanical deceleration timing
  - Test attribute selection randomization and conversion to quiz format
  - Write integration tests for complete three-tap user journey
  - Test navigation between slot machine and quiz features
  - Verify analytics tracking accuracy for all slot machine events
  - Test cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
