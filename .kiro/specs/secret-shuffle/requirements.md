# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Secret Shuffle feature adds a magical "surprise me" mechanic to the existing Secret Cocktail Menu App. This feature provides users with an alternative discovery path through a slot machine-style animation that randomly selects cocktails from the existing database. The shuffle feature maintains the same premium aesthetic and complimentary messaging while offering a playful, spontaneous cocktail discovery experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bar guest, I want to access a "surprise me" option from the main menu, so that I can discover cocktails through spontaneous selection rather than answering quiz questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display both "Start Quiz" and "Surprise Me" options
2. WHEN a user clicks "Surprise Me" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the shuffle interface
3. WHEN the shuffle page loads THEN the system SHALL display a premium slot machine-style interface
4. WHEN the shuffle interface appears THEN the system SHALL maintain the same Tesla/Rolex-inspired aesthetic as the main app
5. WHEN accessing the shuffle feature THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard mobile connections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bar guest, I want to interact with a three-tap slot machine that builds my cocktail profile through flavor and mood selections, so that I feel actively involved in creating my personalized recommendation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a shuffle THEN the system SHALL display a slot machine interface with three reels
2. WHEN the slot machine appears THEN the system SHALL immediately start all three reels spinning simultaneously
3. WHEN all reels are spinning THEN the system SHALL show the first reel with flavor attributes (sweet, bitter, citrus, herbal, spicy, etc.), the second reel with mood attributes (adventurous, elegant, playful, cozy, celebratory, etc.), and the third reel with style attributes (classic, experimental, light, boozy, etc.)
4. WHEN a user taps the screen for the first time THEN the system SHALL gradually slow down and stop the first reel with mechanical deceleration animation, landing on a random flavor attribute while the other two reels continue spinning
5. WHEN a user taps the screen for the second time THEN the system SHALL gradually slow down and stop the second reel with the same mechanical deceleration, landing on a random mood attribute while the third reel continues spinning
6. WHEN a user taps the screen for the third time THEN the system SHALL gradually slow down and stop the third reel with mechanical deceleration, landing on a random style attribute and begin cocktail matching
7. WHEN each reel stops THEN the system SHALL use realistic mechanical timing with gradual deceleration over 1-2 seconds, not instant stopping
8. WHEN displaying the spinning reels THEN the system SHALL ensure all three reels spin at the same speed and visual style for consistency, with smooth mechanical rotation that mimics real slot machine physics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bar guest, I want the slot machine results to be used to find a cocktail that matches my randomly selected attributes, so that I receive a personalized recommendation based on the flavor/mood/style combination I landed on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all three reels have stopped THEN the system SHALL use the selected attributes (flavor + mood + style) to search the cocktail database
2. WHEN matching cocktails THEN the system SHALL use the same recommendation engine as the quiz feature, treating the slot results as quiz answers
3. WHEN displaying the matched cocktail THEN the system SHALL show which attributes were selected: "Your reels landed on: [Citrus] + [Adventurous] + [Classic]"
4. WHEN presenting the result THEN the system SHALL use complimentary language like "The spirits aligned perfectly! Your combination of [attributes] led us to this exquisite creation..."
5. WHEN showing the shuffle result THEN the system SHALL display the same detailed cocktail information as quiz results (name, ingredients, description, garnish, glassware)
6. WHEN displaying the matched cocktail THEN the system SHALL include 3 adjacent cocktail recommendations from similar attribute combinations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bar guest, I want clear visual feedback during each tap and smooth animations between reels, so that the slot machine experience feels responsive and premium.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps to stop a reel THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (button press effect, haptic feedback on mobile) but begin the mechanical deceleration process
2. WHEN a reel is decelerating THEN the system SHALL show realistic mechanical slowing with slight bounce/settle effect when it stops, like a real slot machine
3. WHEN a reel stops spinning THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected attribute with premium styling and brief celebration animation
4. WHEN transitioning between stopped reels THEN the system SHALL maintain the mechanical authenticity while building anticipation for the next tap
5. WHEN all reels are complete THEN the system SHALL display a brief "matching your perfect combination..." loading state with slot machine-style fanfare
6. WHEN the slot machine is active THEN the system SHALL show clear instructions: "Tap to stop reel 1 of 3", "Tap to stop reel 2 of 3", etc.
7. WHEN displaying spinning reels THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth 60fps animations with realistic mechanical physics that feel authentic and premium

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bar guest, I want to easily play the slot machine again or switch to the quiz, so that I can explore different cocktails through various discovery methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing shuffle results THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Spin Again" button with premium slot machine styling
2. WHEN a user clicks "Spin Again" THEN the system SHALL return to the three-reel slot machine interface
3. WHEN viewing shuffle results THEN the system SHALL provide a "Take the Quiz Instead" option for users who want guided discovery
4. WHEN navigating between features THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and consistent premium aesthetics
5. WHEN using multiple spins THEN the system SHALL ensure variety in the attribute combinations to provide different cocktail discoveries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a bar owner, I want the shuffle feature to use the same cocktail database and recommendation engine as the quiz, so that I maintain consistency and only need one data source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shuffle feature matches cocktails THEN the system SHALL use the same JSON cocktail database as the quiz feature
2. WHEN processing slot machine results THEN the system SHALL use the same recommendation engine logic, treating the three selected attributes as equivalent to quiz answers
3. WHEN cocktails are updated in the database THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in both quiz and shuffle features without separate configuration
4. WHEN the slot machine selects attributes THEN the system SHALL map them to the existing flavor_tags, mood_tags, and style preferences used by the quiz
5. WHEN managing the cocktail database THEN the system SHALL require no additional fields or configuration for shuffle compatibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a bar owner, I want to track slot machine usage and attribute combinations through analytics, so that I can understand how guests interact with the shuffle feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the shuffle feature THEN the system SHALL track "slot_machine_started" events in analytics
2. WHEN each reel stops THEN the system SHALL track which attributes were selected for each reel position
3. WHEN a slot machine sequence completes THEN the system SHALL track "slot_machine_completed" events with the final attribute combination and matched cocktail
4. WHEN users click "Spin Again" THEN the system SHALL track repeat slot machine usage patterns
5. WHEN analyzing usage data THEN the system SHALL provide insights into popular attribute combinations and slot machine vs quiz preference
